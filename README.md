The goal of this project is to build two models that classify photoplethysmogram, PPG, and peaks. The models are aimed to solve binary and multi-class classification problems and they should provide an estimation of the confidence of the prediction. The multi-class model classifies into 3 classes:
- Normal (N)
- Premature Supraventricular Contraction (S)
- Premature Ventricular Contraction (V)

while the binary classifier classifies an input sample into pathological (S and V) and non-pathological (N). Moreover, one metric should be defined to monitor and evaluate the performance of the models.
